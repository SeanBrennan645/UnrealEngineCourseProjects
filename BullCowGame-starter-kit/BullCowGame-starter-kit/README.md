# BullCowGame
Part of the 3rd section of the course this project introduces a basic terminal game
that exists within an Unreal engine project to introduce to some of the syntax used in the c++ code
for Unreal.

The game is a word guessing game where the player must guess an isogram, on incorrect guesses the player
will recieve bulls to indicate that they have a correct letter in the right place and cows if they have a correct
letter in the wrong place.

The game as I have left it includes a debug line which prints the hidden word to the terminal
